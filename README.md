EDA and Recommendation System Projects
Welcome to the repository for EDA and Recommendation System projects. This repository contains code and resources for exploring datasets and building recommendation systems.
Introduction
This repository hosts two main types of projects:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): These projects involve analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. EDA helps in understanding the data, detecting patterns, and preparing it for further analysis.

Recommendation System: These projects involve building systems that recommend items to users based on various algorithms. The goal is to provide personalized recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the EDA directory, you'll find:

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks that perform various data exploration tasks such as data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.
Scripts: Python scripts that automate parts of the EDA process.
Data: Raw and processed datasets used for exploration.
Usage
To explore the data, open the relevant Jupyter notebook in the notebooks directory and run the cells to perform EDA tasks.

Recommendation System
In the recommendation directory, you'll find:

Scripts: Python scripts to build and evaluate recommendation algorithms.
Models: Trained models or code to build and train models.
Data: Datasets used for training and testing the recommendation system.
Usage
To run a recommendation algorithm, execute the relevant Python script from the scripts directory. Make sure to adjust any paths or parameters as needed.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data analysis and building recommendation systems.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for EDA.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical operations.
Scikit-Learn: Machine learning library for building models.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization libraries.
